# Finalized Masterwork Plans

### Masterwork #1. Restructive Firearm (Wand, Requires Attunement)


-   Planned Tweak Damage Type
   
-   Level 1: Magic Revolver, This revolver is fueled by magic and deals 2d6 fire damage instead of piercing damage. It uses special mana absorbing crystal chambers as ammunition. You may recharge the crystal chambers as a bonus action when all six shots have been fired, you may not use it to attack on this turn.
    
-   Level 2: +1 Weapon
    
-   Level 3: Hand Eye Coordination (You may use intelligence instead of strength or dex for this weapon)
    
-   Level 4: Smoking hands (When you store this revolver, it transforms into a ring on your finger, this ring is impossible to remove, and you have advantage on checks to pass it off as an ordinary ring, in addition, while in ring form, this revolver can imbue your unarmed strikes with the power of your normal shots (minus one damage dice), and you may add that elemental damage to your attacks. When you do this you expend a chamber as if it were fired, the same rules as before apply, but if you spend all six chambers you take 2d4 fire damage)
    
-   Level 5: Damage cells ( This weapon uses d6 as magical damage dice instead of physical damage. At level 5 every hit deals 4d6 damage instead of 2d6)
    
-   Level 6: Mana Rifle, (You may transform this weapon into a Mana Rifle as a bonus action, you may not use it to attack while doing so.) In this state, your rifle has 1 charge for each of your damage dice. You may expend a charge to deal a number of damage equal to 2 * your standard damage dice. When you do this, you lose one damage dice from your revolver’s attacks until this weapon is fully recharged. This has no impact on the rifle, but when all charges have been expended you are unable to fire in any state, until this weapon regains it’s charges. You may recharge it using your charge refill, and also over a long rest You may fire the mana rifle no more than 3 times before recharging it) 
    
-   Level 7: +2 Weapon
    
-   Level 8: Spell Disruption, (When an opponent casts a spell, you may fire your Mana Rifle as a Reaction. Doing this causes a disruptive burst of magic to be fired at your target, on a hit the spell is interrupted and fails. You may use this feature in revolver form as well, and it incurs the price of firing your mana rifle.)
    
-   Level 9: Mana Beam (You may spend one turn charging your mana rifle to transform it from an attack roll to a save against your craftsmanship score. Every creature in a 60 foot triangle must make a dex save as you pan your rifle across the field of battle releasing a devastating beam.)
    
-   Level 10: Damage Cell improvement (You gain an additional 2 Damage Dice bringing your revolver up to 6d6 instead of 4d6)
    
-   Level 11: Arcane Railgun (As an action, you may transform your weapon into a railgun, When you fire this weapon, expend all charges from your Mana Rifle incurring the standard penalty, and then deal 4* your damage dice’s damage. When you fire this weapon, make a DC20 Strength check, on a fail you move 10 feet backwards and are knocked prone. If you collide with an object or person, you do not fall prone but take 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Once you use this feature, you are unable to use your weapon for 2 turns, You may make a DC 18 Tinker’s tools check as an action to end this effect early. When fired in this way, you permanently lose 1 damage dice until your next long rest due to structural damage to your weapon.)
    
-   Level 12: +3 Weapon
    
-   Level 13: Improved Mana rifle (You may now fire your mana rifle 4 times before reloading it.)
    
-   Level 14: Spell Shells(You may prepare a spell shell, similar to a spell storing ring. If someone casts a spell of 5th level or lower into it, you may fire it in your arcane railgun destroying the shell, and causing the effects of the shell to apply as if cast where you shoot the railgun)
    
-   Level 15: concussive Blast (You may change the way your Arcane Railgun fires, causing a save against your makerscore inside a 30 foot sphere centered around the impact. To avoid the Damage dealt)
    

  
  

### Masterwork #2. OmniTool

-   Planned Tweak. Possibly a weapon state or specialty item. 
   
-   Level 1: Symbiotic Tool: (This silvery metallic ooze is a magically sustained programmable symbiote. It can transform into any set of tools as an action. When dormant, it seeps into the skin pores on your right arm taking on the appearance of a reflective metal tattoo which can move and shift. It is a sentient item, and has a true neutral alignment, though it obeys it’s creator completely. This symbiote is a familiar though it cannot take any of the familiar’s standard actions. It is disabled by antimagic but otherwise cannot be damaged. It cannot speak but understands it’s owner’s telepathic and verbal speech. It can communicate vague ideas and emotions but nothing else. (Requires Attunement))
    
-   Level 2: Chemical manipulation (Over the course of an hour, the symbiote can be used to break down simple matter into elements which it stores in special beakers for your later use. You may make an alchemy check over the course of an hour to attempt to use a chemistry set to combine the elements into chemical compounds. If creating the desired chemical compound is a multi step process, each step requires an additional alchemy check. The symbiote can record successful checks and then perform them on it’s own over an hour later on given the elements necessary. The symbiote can record a number of chemical recipes equal to your intelligence score.)
    
-   Level 3: +1 Tools(Increases tool checks with it as well as craftsmanship score)
    
-   Level 4:  Mundane form (the symbiote may transform into any non magical simple item or tool. 
    
-   Level 5: Direct injection (The symbiote may directly inject a target with a single dose of a chemical stored inside it, as an action on your turn you may make a medicine check against a target’s AC which they may voluntarily allow to succeed. This check ignores expertise if you have it. On a success, the target is injected with whatever chemical the symbiote contains.
    
-   Level 6: Repairative injection (As an action you may make the symbiote partially enter an ally, losing that portion of itself in order to allow it to travel through a target patching it up and repairing fatal damage. The target gains 10 temp hp for 60 seconds, which also raises a downed target back into combat. Your omni tool has 10 charges. Doing this consumes one charge.)
    
-   Level 7: Reviving injection (As an action you may inject a target that has died within the last 30 seconds with your omni tool. Doing this returns this target to life with one temporary hitpoint that lasts for a minute. Doing this costs 3 charges and requires chemicals worth 300 GP
    
-   Level 8: +2 tool
    
-   Level 9: Deflective carapace (As a reaction to taking damage, you can cause your omni tool to spread out encasing the targeted area in silvery metallic armor. You may spend 2 charges to increase your AC by 5 until the end of your turn. 
    
-   Level 10: Charge absorption (You may recharge the symbiote’s charges as a bonus action.)
    
-   Level 11: Chemical Storage (Your Omnitool can store 5 doses of any liquid chemicals or vapors for injection. A dose is equivalent to whatever amount is required to achieve the desired effect, IE a healing potion, or a poison. These doses can be poured into vials for later use if they are collected, or they can be used through the Direct Injection Feature. This feature also allows the symbiote to glean poison off of a poisoned weapon if it is unused.)
    
-   Level 12: Flesh Weaver (At the end of each of your turns the symbiote may take an action to repair your body, spinning new flesh from itself. If it uses this feature you lose one charge, and gain 20 temp hp. This temp hp cannot exceed your hitpoint maximum, and healing removes an amount of this hp equal to the amount healed. You may use this feature on yourself or an ally within touch range and it does not consume an action or bonus action as the symbiote acts independently.)
    
-   Level 13: +3 tool
    
-   Level 14: Improved symbiote (Your omni tool can act more like a regular familiar. It can now take any of the normal actions a familiar can take, and can stretch 30 feet away from you. Instead of delivering a spell, it can perform an injection, though it will require your action as well to do this as usual for a familiar.)
    
-   Level 15: Enhanced charges (Your symbiote now has 15 charges)
    

  
  
  

### Masterwork #3. Liquid Armor

-   Planned Tweak: Terrain Adaptation (Cold gear, Rebreather, Climbing boots etc)
   
-   Level 1: Cloak of many fashions. (This cloak is an extension of your Omni Tool, though it is treated as separate.)
    
-   Level 2: Armor Absorption (The symbiotic Cloak can absorb armor and replicate its properties regardless of shape or size. The Armor’s normal statistics are maintained, however it’s appearance and form vary. Normally this cloak appears as a labcoat, however it’s true form is the same as your omni tool, a shiny metallic symbiote reminiscent of gallium that flows like liquid metal. You can command it to change forms as a bonus action. It can flow into your body’s pores the same as your omni tool appearing as a metallic tattoo covering your torso and legs. As long as your armor is not in tattoo form it functions as normal armor, however it is indistinguishable from ordinary clothes until you are attacked at which point it either stops the blow if it is protected or extrudes a protective shield to unarmored areas. In this case the AC of the armor you are actually wearing becomes as apparent as if they saw the actual armor. You may not absorb any special properties of the armor. 
    
-   Level 3: +1 Armor
    
-   Level 4: Stealth Armor (Regardless of the type of armor absorbed, it grants no penalty to stealth and you may rest normally, in other words you may treat the armor as if you are not wearing it. 
    
-   Level 5: Iron Web ((Attunement)You may use an action to attempt to grapple a target 30 feet away from you or closer by spraying them with your symbiote and roping them down with metallic tendrils. You make this grappling check with your intelligence modifier, and it occupies one of your hands and you can move no further than 30 linear feet from your target. Other than this, the grapple has no other effects on you. If the target breaks the grapple you lose one charge from your symbiote, if you release it on your own you do not lose any charges. You cannot use this ability if you have less than 3 charges remaining.(Armor has 10 charges))
    
-   Level 6: Symbiotic Strength (You may spend 1 charge to use your intelligence instead of strength for a strength check or saving throw)
    
-   Level 7: Rapid Charging (You may recharge your armor as a bonus action)
    
-   Level 8: +2 Armor
    
-   Level 9: Steel Angel (You may spend 5 charges to cause the symbiote to transform into a pair of large metallic wings. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet for the next 10 minutes.)
    
-   Level 10: Antimagic injection (As a reaction to falling under a spell's effect, you may expend 5 charges to inject yourself with antimagic. Until the end of your next turn you act as if under the effects of the antimagic field spell, meaning all attunement is suppressed as well as spells. Furthermore if a spell has an effect on you that lasts such as charm person or protection from good and evil the effect ends instead of being suppressed. The symbiote loses all standard properties. If you are in the air, it locks down your body restraining you and causes you to stay in position. If you are on the ground it transforms into the armor it has absorbed until your attunement returns. You may attempt to use this feature as a reaction or an action on someone else by using your omnitool’s direct injection property. When used on yourself you need not be conscious or willing, as the armor acts independently.)
    
-   Level 11: Puppet strings (As an action you may make an attack against a target using the omni tool and your intelligence modifier to hit. This can only target medium or smaller creatures. The target’s physical movements come under your control as thin metallic wires wrap around it and control it. The target may make a strength check against your craftsmanship score to attempt to break the omnitools restraints. On a succes your symbiote loses 5 charges, on a failure the target takes 1d4 slashing damage.)
    
-   Level 12: Defensive shielding, as a bonus action you may expend one charge to activate a shield similar to an awakened shield for 10 minutes. 
    
-   Level 13: +3 Armor
    
-   Level 14: Additional Charges (You now have 15 charges)
    
-   Level 15: Unconscious Movement (Should you die, go down, or lose consciousness, your symbiote may simply move around with you inside it. It fully encloses you transforming into a metallic humanoid, The symbiote retains its AC as well as any features of it or the Omnitool, but otherwise cannot use magic or magic items. It is immune to charmed,sleep,and effects that target humanoids or require a mind to function. The symbiote has hp equal to the number of charges left *10. It cannot verbally communicate. While awakened in this state the symbiote’s sole objective is protecting its owner and it will take any action to ensure the safety of its owner. Any damage the symbiote takes is also taken by the person inside of it, and if it drops to 0 hp, it dies, though it can be regrown over 1d4 weeks as long as any parts of it remain and it can be consistently fed metal. This state can also be activated by the owner voluntarily and instructed to perform simple tasks or to protect someone else in a similar fashion.)
    

  

### Masterwork #4 . Portal Gun

-   Planned Tweak (no Idea tbh)
   
-   Level 5: Gun based portable hole. (Normal portable hole, but you can point to apply it to any surface within 10 feet.)
    
-   Level 6: Multiplied Storage ((Attunement)You may use this portal gun to open a number of portable holes equal to twice your intelligence modifier. These holes may not be placed inside each other, and can only be accessed by the person creating them. You may not have negative holes. Anyone may open a hole, but these holes are the only ones you are able to reopen later. If the hole is opened from the inside instead of appearing where the hole currently is it appears where the hole last was.) 
    
-   Level 7: Dimensional Bandit (If you point this tool at an opened portable hole, bag of holding or otherwise extradimensional space, you may instead of having one of your holes, keep a record of it’s interdimensional coordinates, you may then at any time open a 1 foot diameter circular opening into the container. You may move this hole around inside the container in order to reach everywhere inside.)
    
-   Level 8: Blip (You may point the Portal gun at a point within 250 feet, you and one creature you may touch teleport exiting through a portable hole that opens in that location. Cost 1 charge. Your portal gun has 3 charges)
    
-   Level 9: Arcane Beacons (Given one day’s work, you can construct an arcane beacon, at the price of 2 charges, you may teleport to any arcane beacon you have created. You may have a number of arcane beacons equal to your intelligence modifier+your proficiency bonus. When you create a new beacon, if that beacon is higher than that number, the oldest beacon crumbles to dust
    
-   Level 10: Magic Circle Jacking (If you expend 1 charge, you can temporarily hijack a magic circle, activating it and teleporting to another teleportation circle, who’s sigil you can input.)
    
-   Level 11: Blip Beacon (You may craft a number of blip beacons equal to your proficiency bonus. You always know the locations of these beacons as long as you are within 1000 feet of them. They may be any shape and disguised as anything as long as it is at least one inch in diameter. You may use blip to teleport to any of these beacons as long as you are within 500 feet even if you do not have a direct line of sight. 
    
-   Level 12: Portal (You may open two openings to a bag of holding. These openings stay open for one round, and allow you to pass through both without consuming additional movement speed, the portals must be within 500 feet of each other, and must be within 500 feet of you and either line of sight, centered on a blip beacon, or centered on an arcane beacon.
    
-   Level 13: Teleportation (You may use your Arcane Beacons to determine the location of a geographical area on a plane in which you have at least three beacons. You must then know the latitude and longitude of the location. With this information and a complicated equation, you may spend 3 charges to open up a gate to this location as an action. The gate allows medium or smaller creatures to pass through and is open for one round. The DM determines the vertical altitude of the area you come out of, but it is always on the nearest flat wall, and adjacent to a floor of some kind. It is generally as close to the surface of the planet as possible. You always get the same vertical location given the coordinates, though it can change if that location is destroyed. To allow for finding the best output surface this ability gives some leeway on horizontal directions at the DM’s discretion. To perform the equation, make a roll against 20-your intelligence modifier. On a success you teleport correctly, on a failure, you are off target by a margin of 10^number failed by miles. Rolling the number exactly counts as a failure and the offset is zero giving a 1 mile change in direction. The exact location is determined by the DM. On a crit fail roll a d4, on a 1 you are teleported to a random plane, on any other number the portal simply fizzles. If you are off plane, unless you have at least 3 arcane beacons you cannot travel on that plane, however you may return to any plane you do have beacons on. You may also choose to travel to a plane using an attuned rod similarly to planeshift though you have no control over your destination.
    
-   Level 14: Extradimensional Barrier (By expending 3 charges, you may ward a 30 foot cube against dimensional travel for 1d100 days. If this affects a teleportation circle, the circle cannot be used by anyone. You may expend 3 more charges to lift this Barrier, and you may make a number of barriers equal to your intelligence modifier.)
    
-   Level 15: Constructed Plane (By expending 3 charges, and one full recharge, you may create your own demiplane. From then on, you may use your teleportation feature to go back and forth from this demiplane identically to the demiplane spell.)
