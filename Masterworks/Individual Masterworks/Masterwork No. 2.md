## Masterwork #2. OmniTool

-   **Planned Tweak:** Possibly a weapon state like in FMA or specialty item like a unique tool or something. 
   
-   **Level 1:** Symbiotic Tool: (This silvery metallic ooze is a magically sustained programmable symbiote. It can transform into any set of tools as an action. When dormant, it seeps into the skin pores on your right arm taking on the appearance of a reflective metal tattoo which can move and shift. It is a sentient item, and has a true neutral alignment, though it obeys it’s creator completely. This symbiote is a familiar though it cannot take any of the familiar’s standard actions. It is disabled by antimagic but otherwise cannot be damaged. It cannot speak but understands it’s owner’s telepathic and verbal speech. It can communicate vague ideas and emotions but nothing else. (Requires Attunement))
    
-   **Level 2:** Chemical manipulation (Over the course of an hour, the symbiote can be used to break down simple matter into elements which it stores in special beakers for your later use. You may make an alchemy check over the course of an hour to attempt to use a chemistry set to combine the elements into chemical compounds. If creating the desired chemical compound is a multi step process, each step requires an additional alchemy check. The symbiote can record successful checks and then perform them on it’s own over an hour later on given the elements necessary. The symbiote can record a number of chemical recipes equal to your intelligence score.)
    
-   **Level 3:** +1 Tools(Increases tool checks with it as well as craftsmanship score)
    
-   **Level 4: ** Mundane form (the symbiote may transform into any non magical simple item or tool. 
    
-   **Level 5:** Direct injection (The symbiote may directly inject a target with a single dose of a chemical stored inside it, as an action on your turn you may make a medicine check against a target’s AC which they may voluntarily allow to succeed. This check ignores expertise if you have it. On a success, the target is injected with whatever chemical the symbiote contains.
    
-   **Level 6:** Repairative injection (As an action you may make the symbiote partially enter an ally, losing that portion of itself in order to allow it to travel through a target patching it up and repairing fatal damage. The target gains 10 temp hp for 60 seconds, which also raises a downed target back into combat. Your omni tool has 10 charges. Doing this consumes one charge.)
    
-   **Level 7:** Reviving injection (As an action you may inject a target that has died within the last 30 seconds with your omni tool. Doing this returns this target to life with one temporary hitpoint that lasts for a minute. Doing this costs 3 charges and requires chemicals worth 300 GP
    
-  ** Level 8**  +2 tool
    
-  ** Level 9**  Deflective carapace (As a reaction to taking damage, you can cause your omni tool to spread out encasing the targeted area in silvery metallic armor. You may spend 2 charges to increase your AC by 5 until the end of your turn. 
    
-  ** Level 10**  Charge absorption (You may recharge the symbiote’s charges as a bonus action.)
    
-  ** Level 11:** Chemical Storage (Your Omnitool can store 5 doses of any liquid chemicals or vapors for injection. A dose is equivalent to whatever amount is required to achieve the desired effect, IE a healing potion, or a poison. These doses can be poured into vials for later use if they are collected, or they can be used through the Direct Injection Feature. This feature also allows the symbiote to glean poison off of a poisoned weapon if it is unused.)
    
-   Level 12: Flesh Weaver (At the end of each of your turns the symbiote may take an action to repair your body, spinning new flesh from itself. If it uses this feature you lose one charge, and gain 20 temp hp. This temp hp cannot exceed your hitpoint maximum, and healing removes an amount of this hp equal to the amount healed. You may use this feature on yourself or an ally within touch range and it does not consume an action or bonus action as the symbiote acts independently.)
    
-   Level 13: +3 tool
    
-   Level 14: Improved symbiote (Your omni tool can act more like a regular familiar. It can now take any of the normal actions a familiar can take, and can stretch 30 feet away from you. Instead of delivering a spell, it can perform an injection, though it will require your action as well to do this as usual for a familiar.)
    
-   Level 15: Enhanced charges (Your symbiote now has 15 charges)
