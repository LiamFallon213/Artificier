## Masterwork #1. Restructive Firearm (Wand, Requires Attunement)


-   **Planned Tweak** Damage Type
   
-   **Level 1:** Magic Revolver, This revolver is fueled by magic and deals 2d6 fire damage instead of piercing damage. It uses special mana absorbing crystal chambers as ammunition. You may recharge the crystal chambers as a bonus action when all six shots have been fired, you may not use it to attack on this turn.
    
-   **Level 2:** +1 Weapon
    
-   **Level 3:** Hand Eye Coordination (You may use intelligence instead of strength or dex for this weapon)
    
-   **Level 4:** Smoking hands (When you store this revolver, it transforms into a ring on your finger, this ring is impossible to remove, and you have advantage on checks to pass it off as an ordinary ring, in addition, while in ring form, this revolver can imbue your unarmed strikes with the power of your normal shots (minus one damage dice), and you may add that elemental damage to your attacks. When you do this you expend a chamber as if it were fired, the same rules as before apply, but if you spend all six chambers you take 2d4 fire damage)
    
-  ** Level 5:**  Damage cells ( This weapon uses d6 as magical damage dice instead of physical damage. At level 5 every hit deals 4d6 damage instead of 2d6)
    
-  ** Level 6:** Mana Rifle, (You may transform this weapon into a Mana Rifle as a bonus action, you may not use it to attack while doing so.) In this state, your rifle has 1 charge for each of your damage dice. You may expend a charge to deal a number of damage equal to 2 * your standard damage dice. When you do this, you lose one damage dice from your revolver’s attacks until this weapon is fully recharged. This has no impact on the rifle, but when all charges have been expended you are unable to fire in any state, until this weapon regains it’s charges. You may recharge it using your charge refill, and also over a long rest You may fire the mana rifle no more than 3 times before recharging it) 
    
-  ** Level 7**  +2 Weapon
    
-   **Level 8:** Spell Disruption, (When an opponent casts a spell, you may fire your Mana Rifle as a Reaction. Doing this causes a disruptive burst of magic to be fired at your target, on a hit the spell is interrupted and fails. You may use this feature in revolver form as well, and it incurs the price of firing your mana rifle.)
    
-   **Level 9:** Mana Beam (You may spend one turn charging your mana rifle to transform it from an attack roll to a save against your craftsmanship score. Every creature in a 60 foot triangle must make a dex save as you pan your rifle across the field of battle releasing a devastating beam.)
    
-   **Level 10:** Damage Cell improvement (You gain an additional 2 Damage Dice bringing your revolver up to 6d6 instead of 4d6)
    
-   **Level 11:** Arcane Railgun (As an action, you may transform your weapon into a railgun, When you fire this weapon, expend all charges from your Mana Rifle incurring the standard penalty, and then deal 4* your damage dice’s damage. When you fire this weapon, make a DC20 Strength check, on a fail you move 10 feet backwards and are knocked prone. If you collide with an object or person, you do not fall prone but take 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Once you use this feature, you are unable to use your weapon for 2 turns, You may make a DC 18 Tinker’s tools check as an action to end this effect early. When fired in this way, you permanently lose 1 damage dice until your next long rest due to structural damage to your weapon.)
    
-   **Level 12:** +3 Weapon
    
-   **Level 13:** Improved Mana rifle (You may now fire your mana rifle 4 times before reloading it.)
    
-   **Level 14:** Spell Shells(You may prepare a spell shell, similar to a spell storing ring. If someone casts a spell of 5th level or lower into it, you may fire it in your arcane railgun destroying the shell, and causing the effects of the shell to apply as if cast where you shoot the railgun)
    
-   **Level 15:** concussive Blast (You may change the way your Arcane Railgun fires, causing a save against your makerscore inside a 30 foot sphere centered around the impact. To avoid the Damage dealt)
