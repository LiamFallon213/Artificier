## Masterwork #3. Liquid Armor

-   **Planned Tweak:** Terrain Adaptation (Cold gear, Rebreather, Climbing boots etc)
   
-   **Level 1:** Cloak of many fashions. (This cloak is an extension of your Omni Tool, though it is treated as separate.)
    
-   **Level 2:** Armor Absorption (The symbiotic Cloak can absorb armor and replicate its properties regardless of shape or size. The Armor’s normal statistics are maintained, however it’s appearance and form vary. Normally this cloak appears as a labcoat, however it’s true form is the same as your omni tool, a shiny metallic symbiote reminiscent of gallium that flows like liquid metal. You can command it to change forms as a bonus action. It can flow into your body’s pores the same as your omni tool appearing as a metallic tattoo covering your torso and legs. As long as your armor is not in tattoo form it functions as normal armor, however it is indistinguishable from ordinary clothes until you are attacked at which point it either stops the blow if it is protected or extrudes a protective shield to unarmored areas. In this case the AC of the armor you are actually wearing becomes as apparent as if they saw the actual armor. You may not absorb any special properties of the armor. 
    
-   **Level 3:** Deflective carapace (As a reaction to taking damage, you can cause your omni tool to spread out encasing the targeted area in silvery metallic armor. You may spend 2 charges to increase your AC by 3 until the end of your turn. 
    
-   **Level 4:** Stealth Armor (Regardless of the type of armor absorbed, it grants no penalty to stealth and you may rest normally, in other words you may treat the armor as if you are not wearing it. 
    
-   **Level 5:** Iron Web ((Attunement)You may use an action to attempt to grapple a target 30 feet away from you or closer by spraying them with your symbiote and roping them down with metallic tendrils. You make this grappling check with your intelligence modifier, and it occupies one of your hands and you can move no further than 30  feet from your target in a straight line. Other than this, the grapple has no other effects on you. If the target breaks the grapple you lose one charge from your symbiote, if you release it on your own you do not lose any charges. You cannot use this ability if you have less than 3 charges remaining.(Armor has 10 charges))
    
-   **Level 6:** Symbiotic Strength (You may spend 1 charge to use your intelligence instead of strength or dexterity for a strength or dexterity check)
    
-   **Level 7:** Rapid Charging (You may recharge your armor as a bonus action)
    
-   **Level 8:** Duplicate Self (Your armor can become an automaton in service to you. )
    
-   **Level 9:** Steel Angel (You may spend 5 charges over the course of a minuite to cause the symbiote to transform into a pair of large metallic wings. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet for the next 10 minutes.)
    
-   **Level 10:** Antimagic injection (As a reaction to falling under a spell's effect, you may expend 3 charges to inject yourself with antimagic. You gain advantage on the spell saving throw.)
    
-   **Level 11:** 
    
-   **Level 12:** Quantum Shielding, Your form becomes fuzzy as you expand your quantum probability cone. As an action you may expend one charge to gain a +2 to AC for one hour you must absorb a shield to use this. 
    
-   **Level 13:** Additional Charges (You now have 15 charges)
    
-   **Level 14:** 
    
-   **Level 15:** Unconscious Movement (Should you die, go down, or lose consciousness, your symbiote may simply move around with you inside it. It fully encloses you transforming into a metallic humanoid, The symbiote retains its AC as well as any features of it or the Omnitool, but otherwise cannot use magic or magic items. It is immune to charmed,sleep,and effects that target humanoids or require a mind to function. The symbiote has hp equal to the number of charges left *10. It cannot verbally communicate. While awakened in this state the symbiote’s sole objective is protecting its owner and it will take any action to ensure the safety of its owner. Any damage the symbiote takes is also taken by the person inside of it, and if it drops to 0 hp, it dies, though it can be regrown over 1d4 weeks as long as any parts of it remain and it can be consistently fed metal. This state can also be activated by the owner voluntarily and instructed to perform simple tasks or to protect someone else in a similar fashion.)
