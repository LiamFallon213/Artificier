## Masterwork #3. Liquid Armor

-   **Planned Tweak:** Terrain Adaptation (Cold gear, Rebreather, Climbing boots etc)
   
-   **Level 1:** Cloak of many fashions. (This cloak is an extension of your Omni Tool, though it is treated as separate.)
    
-   **Level 2:** Armor Absorption (The symbiotic Cloak can absorb armor and replicate its properties regardless of shape or size. The Armor’s normal statistics are maintained, however it’s appearance and form vary. Normally this cloak appears as a labcoat, however it’s true form is the same as your omni tool, a shiny metallic symbiote reminiscent of gallium that flows like liquid metal. You can command it to change forms as a bonus action. It can flow into your body’s pores the same as your omni tool appearing as a metallic tattoo covering your torso and legs. As long as your armor is not in tattoo form it functions as normal armor, however it is indistinguishable from ordinary clothes until you are attacked at which point it either stops the blow if it is protected or extrudes a protective shield to unarmored areas. In this case the AC of the armor you are actually wearing becomes as apparent as if they saw the actual armor. You may not absorb any special properties of the armor. 
    
-   **Level 3:** +1 Armor
    
-   **Level 4:** Stealth Armor (Regardless of the type of armor absorbed, it grants no penalty to stealth and you may rest normally, in other words you may treat the armor as if you are not wearing it. 
    
-   **Level 5:** Iron Web ((Attunement)You may use an action to attempt to grapple a target 30 feet away from you or closer by spraying them with your symbiote and roping them down with metallic tendrils. You make this grappling check with your intelligence modifier, and it occupies one of your hands and you can move no further than 30 linear feet from your target. Other than this, the grapple has no other effects on you. If the target breaks the grapple you lose one charge from your symbiote, if you release it on your own you do not lose any charges. You cannot use this ability if you have less than 3 charges remaining.(Armor has 10 charges))
    
-   **Level 6:** Symbiotic Strength (You may spend 1 charge to use your intelligence instead of strength for a strength check or saving throw)
    
-   **Level 7:** Rapid Charging (You may recharge your armor as a bonus action)
    
-   **Level 8:** +2 Armor
    
-   **Level 9:** Steel Angel (You may spend 5 charges to cause the symbiote to transform into a pair of large metallic wings. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet for the next 10 minutes.)
    
-   **Level 10:** Antimagic injection (As a reaction to falling under a spell's effect, you may expend 5 charges to inject yourself with antimagic. Until the end of your next turn you act as if under the effects of the antimagic field spell, meaning all attunement is suppressed as well as spells. Furthermore if a spell has an effect on you that lasts such as charm person or protection from good and evil the effect ends instead of being suppressed. The symbiote loses all standard properties. If you are in the air, it locks down your body restraining you and causes you to stay in position. If you are on the ground it transforms into the armor it has absorbed until your attunement returns. You may attempt to use this feature as a reaction or an action on someone else by using your omnitool’s direct injection property. When used on yourself you need not be conscious or willing, as the armor acts independently.)
    
-   **Level 11:** Puppet strings (As an action you may make an attack against a target using the omni tool and your intelligence modifier to hit. This can only target medium or smaller creatures. The target’s physical movements come under your control as thin metallic wires wrap around it and control it. The target may make a strength check against your craftsmanship score to attempt to break the omnitools restraints. On a succes your symbiote loses 5 charges, on a failure the target takes 1d4 slashing damage.)
    
-   **Level 12:** Defensive shielding, as a bonus action you may expend one charge to activate a shield similar to an awakened shield for 10 minutes. 
    
-   **Level 13:** +3 Armor
    
-   **Level 14:** Additional Charges (You now have 15 charges)
    
-   **Level 15:** Unconscious Movement (Should you die, go down, or lose consciousness, your symbiote may simply move around with you inside it. It fully encloses you transforming into a metallic humanoid, The symbiote retains its AC as well as any features of it or the Omnitool, but otherwise cannot use magic or magic items. It is immune to charmed,sleep,and effects that target humanoids or require a mind to function. The symbiote has hp equal to the number of charges left *10. It cannot verbally communicate. While awakened in this state the symbiote’s sole objective is protecting its owner and it will take any action to ensure the safety of its owner. Any damage the symbiote takes is also taken by the person inside of it, and if it drops to 0 hp, it dies, though it can be regrown over 1d4 weeks as long as any parts of it remain and it can be consistently fed metal. This state can also be activated by the owner voluntarily and instructed to perform simple tasks or to protect someone else in a similar fashion.)
