-   Level 9: Increased Accuracy (+2 Weapon)
    
-   Level 10: Smoking hands (When you store these revolvers, they transform into rings on your fingers, these rings are impossible to remove, and you have advantage on checks to pass them off as ordinary rings, in addition, by expending a charge, while in ring form, these revolvers can imbue your unarmed strikes with the power of your arcane bullets, and you may add that elemental damage to your attacks.

-   Level 2: Alchemy add on (Attunement, You add a vial onto your Omni Tool, Your tool gains 50 charges, you can expand these charges to create different chemicals inside the vial. You may then inject them through a needle into either a target using intelligence for the attack roll to determine where to inject, or extrude the contents either directly out of the needle or into a container of your choosing. If you want the contents to remain for more than a day, you must expend 10GP worth of chemicals for every charge you spend. You may fill the tool with a chemical as a bonus action, bt switching what it fills with requires an action. You may create chemicals you know, or attempt to use it as an alchemy tool and make the respective rolls simply instantly. You may also use this as alchemy tools for all purposes you can normally use them. To create chemicals, you must spend a number of charges determined by your DM based on the complexity of what you are trying to create. Furthermore, you may create pre programmed chemical formulas to allow you to instantly create and administer those chemicals at a set charge cost. If you are unattuned to this item you may use it as standard alchemy tools but if you wish to create a chemical or chemical formula you can only create the one pre programmed by the last attuned user.) 
    
-   Level 3: Enhanced Tool ( +1 Tool, bonus to tool checks and craftsmanship score)
    
-   Level 4: Healing Stim ( Chemical Formula 2d8+Int+Proficiency Bonus Health, at the cost of 5 charges)

-   Level 6: Rapid Attunement (This item may be attuned to as an action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus each long rest.)
    
-   Level 7: Expanding Cement ( Chemical Formula. Cost 10 Charges. This foam rapidly expands on contact with the air, increasing to a large size and then hardening into a brittle but strong cement. You may extrude a line of cement up to 30 feet long, which expands to become a one foot wide tube. You may put this line in any shape you wish, break it up, or stack it, however you must be within reach of the area in question when you extrude it. The cement has 4 hit points per square foot, and an AC of 23 If one foot is broken, every adjacent foot takes a -5 penalty to it’s AC. Each square foot weighs about half a pound, but adheres nearly perfectly to any surface it is placed on. This cement weathers quickly and cracks and crumbles within an hour of being created. This cement insulates things trapped inside it, and does not allow them to be targeted with physical attacks when completely covered. It is porous and breathable, and breaking out of it requires a strength check against your craftsmanship score, while all required parts of a creature are covered, it counts as restrained. Furthermore, a target encased in this foam is immune to fall damage, and if the foam falls more than 60 feet it shatters. This foam is lavender Scented, and after one day, dissolves into a harmless pink mist.)
    
-   Level 8: Enhanced Tool (+2 Tool)
    
-   Level 9: Extra Charges (Your Omni Tool Now has 100 Charges)
    
-   Level 10: Ranged Torch ( The laser cutter used in your tinker tools and smith tools can be fired at an extended range at the cost of 5 charges. This beam can be used to make a ranged attack against a metal object. On a hit the object is affected similarly to the heat metal spell for a number of rounds equal to the amount you rolled above the AC of the target, minimum 1)
    
-   Level 11: Improved Healing Stim (Your healing stims now heal for 4d8+int+Pro and now costs 7 charges)
    
-   Level 12: Rapid Attunement (This item may be attuned to as an action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus each long rest.)
    
-   Level 13: Enhanced Tool (+3 Tool)
    
-   Level 14: Liquid Anti Magic (Chemical Formula, cost 50 Charges. Liquid antimagic is an inky black liquid that glimmers faintly purple. It reacts with magic to produce a harmless purple gas consuming the magic. If it is dripped on a surface or person, all magic within a 30 foot radius is consumed and purple vapor is emitted, this chemical can burn away a number of spells equivalent to 9 levels total at which point the reaction is complete. It can also burn away curses, or longstanding magical effects. Furthermore, each round, it burns away any passive magic or attunement in the area nullifying all attuned items for up to nine rounds. Each round removes 1 from the magic’s absorption as if it absorbed a first level spell. This does not deplete charges, but simply severs the attuned connections. Magical effects similar to a spell burn a number of absorption levels equivalent to a spell at the DM’s Discretion. If an amount of magic greater than the absorption level remaining enters the area of the antimagic’s reaction, it fails and the antimagic completely ends, but the remaining loosened magic triggers a wild magic surge on a random target within the 30 foot radius. Liquid antimagic passively dissolves no matter what container it is kept in at the end of one hour due to passive magic. If more than three levels of magic are absorbed in one round, the cloud of purple vapor causes the 30 foot radius to become obscured for a number of rounds equal to the amount of magic being absorbed above 3. If someone is injected with antimagic, they are unable to attune to items, or benefit from magical effects. If someone injected with anti magic tries to cast a spell, it will cause a roll on the wild magic surge table as opposed to the actual spell as long as the spell is lower level than the number of days since injection a higher level spell casts as normal.)
    
-   Level 15: Superior Healing Stim (Your healing stim now heals for 6d8+int+Pro and costs 10 charges)
    
-   Level 16:BloodBurn (Chemical Formula (50 Charges) This chemical can be used as a poison, but it is not poisonous, and does not fall under poison resistance or immunity. Instead it is a chemical that reacts with the oxygen in someone’s blood to produce heat. If the creature has fire resistance or immunity that does not extend to it’s insides such as an armored shell, or fire resistant scales this chemical ignores it. When initially injected the target takes 4d8 fire damage. The target must then make a con save against your craftsmanship score. On a failure they take 4d8 fire damage. They must repeat this save at the end of each of their turns. Every two fails they make grants one level of exhaustion as their internal organs and muscles starve from lack of oxygen. If the target reaches maximum exhaustion from this effect it ends, and instead of dying their strength and constitution scores are reduced to 8 and their speed is halved. These effects persist until all levels of exhaustion are cleared.)
    
-   Level 17: Paralyzing Stim (Cost 30 Charges: Your Omni tool can create a powerful poison that has the potential to paralyze an enemy. Your target is paralyzed when injected and must make a constitution save against your craftsmanship score

-   Level 5: Chemical Recipe (Knockout Drug: Requires 3 charges, roll 5d8, if the target has less than this number of hitpoints, it is knocked unconscious until awoken or 1d8 hours pass. Requires an attack roll using intelligence to determine injection point regardless of what weapon used to apply poison.)
    
-   Level 6:  Rejuvenation Stim (As an action, you may inject a recently dead target and expend 25 charges to restore a target who died within the last minute with one hitpoint. Doing this requires 300 GP worth of special chemicals which go into the formula. 
    
-   Level 7: Chemical Recipe (Quick Dry Cement: You may extrude a line of foam that expands and hardens immediately at the cost of 5 charges. This foam has an AC of 23 and 4 hit points per square foot. You may create a line of this foam 30 feet long with the line being one foot wide. This can be stacked, excreted underneath something, or stuck to walls, as long as it is structurally feasible. While extremely strong this foam is very lightweight. If you entrap someone with it, they must attack the foam to break it, they can only destroy one foot at a time unless they are clearly large enough to destroy more. This foam is porous and breathable, and targets inside it cannot be damaged until the foam breaks as it cushions them from bludgeoning damage and stops piercing and slashing. 
    
-   Level 8: Chemical Recipe (Bloodburn: Cost 7 charges, this special chemical combusts with the oxygen in someones blood when introduced. The target must make a constitution saving throw against your craftsmanship score, if they fail this check they take 4d6 fire damage at the start of each of their turns. They may make another constitution save at the end of their turns. If the target requires oxygen, each two turns someone is affected by this, they gain one level of exhaustion as their muscles atrophy from lack of oxygen. This chemical is not a poison so resistance to poison is useless.)
    
-   Level 9: Improved tools (+2 tools)
    
-   Level 10: Additional Charges (Omni Tool now has 100 Charges)
    
-   Level 11: Chemical Recipe (Improved healing stim: Cost 15 charges target  regains 10d8+intelligence+proficiency Bonus Hit Points)
    
-   Level 12: Chemical Recipe (Undying Flames: Cost 15 charges, This chemical combusts on contact with the air, it deals 4d6 fire damage to anybody who touches it, and anyone who touches it takes 4d6 fire damage at the start of their next turn followed by 3d6, 2d6, 1d6 and then no more as the material burns away. There is no way to put out these flames, they can be suppressed, but as soon as they come into contact with the air again, they catch fire. You may make a line of this flame 30 feet long and 1 foot wide in any shape you wish. As soon as it ignites it begins burning away the same as it does on contact with a person, and the flames go down by 1d6 at the start of each of your turns, everyone who touches them burns for the number of rounds they have left until it burns away. 
    
-   Level 13: Chemical recipes (Poison gas: Cost 20 Charges You may create a 30 foot wide cloud of poison gas as this chemical evaporates into the air. It is invisible but smells horrible. Anyone who is in the cloud when it is created takes 5d8 poison damage, and then takes 5d8 more at the start of each turn in the gas. This gas dissipates after 10 rounds of combat. ) 
    
-   Level 14: Improved Tools (+3 Tools)
    
-   Level 15: Chemical recipe (Antimagic Vapor: Cost 50 Charges and 1000GP worth of magical components. This liquid can be stored in a vial. When it it is broken or exposed to air, it creates a field of gas that nullifies magic. This field operates similar to the antimagic field spell, but instead of being attached to the caster, it stays centered on whatever surface the liquid was pored or shattered on. It persists for 2d4 rounds.

-   Level 18: Chemical Recipe (Paralyzing vapors: Cost 30 Charges. The target must make a constitution save against your craftsmanship score or be paralyzed. They may make this save at the end of each of their turns.

Masterwork #2. OmniTool

-   Planned Tweak. Unkown
    
-   Level 1: Symbiotic Tool: (This silvery metallic ooze is a magically sustained programmable symbiote. It can transform into any set of tools as an action. When dormant, it seeps into the skin pores on your right arm taking on the appearance of a reflective metal tattoo which can move and shift. It is a sentient item, and has a true neutral alignment, though it obeys it’s creator completely. This symbiote is a familiar though it cannot take any of the familiar’s standard actions. It is disabled by antimagic but otherwise cannot be damaged. It cannot speak but understands it’s owner’s telepathic and verbal speech. It can communicate vague ideas and emotions but nothing else. (Requires Attunement))
    
-   Level 2: Chemical manipulation (Over the course of an hour, the symbiote can be used to break down simple matter into elements which it stores in special beakers for your later use. You may make an alchemy check over the course of an hour to attempt to use a chemistry set to combine the elements into chemical compounds. If creating the desired chemical compound is a multi step process, each step requires an additional alchemy check. The symbiote can record successful checks and then perform them on it’s own over an hour later on given the elements necessary. The symbiote can record a number of chemical recipes equal to your intelligence score.)
    
-   Level 3: +1 Tools(Increases tool checks with it as well as craftsmanship score)
    
-   Level 4:  Mundane form (the symbiote may transform into any non magical simple item or tool. 
    
-   Level 5: Direct injection (The symbiote may directly inject a target with a single dose of a chemical stored inside it, as an action on your turn you may make a medicine check against a target’s AC which they may voluntarily allow to succeed. This check ignores expertise if you have it. On a success, the target is injected with whatever chemical the symbiote contains.
   
-   Level 6: Repairative injection (As an action you may make the symbiote partially enter an ally, losing that portion of itself in order to allow it to travel through a target patching it up and repairing fatal damage. The target gains 10 temp hp for 60 seconds, which also raises a downed target back into combat. Your omni tool has 10 charges. Doing this consumes one charge.)
    
-   Level 7: Reviving injection (As an action you may inject a target that has died within the last 30 seconds with your omni tool. Doing this returns this target to life with one temporary hitpoint that lasts for a minute. Doing this costs 3 charges and requires chemicals worth 300 GP
    
-   Level 8: +2 tool
    
-   Level 9: Deflective carapace (As a reaction to taking damage, you can cause your omni tool to spread out encasing the targeted area in silvery metallic armor. You may spend 2 charges to increase your AC by 5 until the end of your turn. 
    
-   Level 10: Charge absorption (You may recharge the symbiote’s charges as a bonus action.)
    
-   Level 11: Chemical Storage (Your Omnitool can store 5 doses of any liquid chemicals or vapors for injection. A dose is equivalent to whatever amount is required to achieve the desired effect, IE a healing potion, or a poison. These doses can be poured into vials for later use if they are collected, or they can be used through the Direct Injection Feature. This feature also allows the symbiote to glean poison off of a poisoned weapon if it is unused.)
    
-   Level 12: Flesh Weaver (At the end of each of your turns the symbiote may take an action to repair your body, spinning new flesh from itself. If it uses this feature you lose one charge, and gain 20 temp hp. This temp hp cannot exceed your hitpoint maximum, and healing removes an amount of this hp equal to the amount healed. You may use this feature on yourself or an ally within touch range and it does not consume an action or bonus action as the symbiote acts independently.)
    
-   Level 13: +3 tool
    
-   Level 14: Improved symbiote (Your omni tool can act more like a regular familiar. It can now take any of the normal actions a familiar can take, and can stretch 30 feet away from you. Instead of delivering a spell, it can perform an injection, though it will require your action as well to do this as usual for a familiar.)
    
-   Level 15: Enhanced charges (Your symbiote now has 15 charges)
    

  
  
  

Masterwork #3 Liquid Armor

-   Planned Tweak
    
-   Level 1: Cloak of many fashions. (This cloak is an extension of your Omni Tool, though it is treated as separate.)
   
-   Level 2: Armor Absorption (The symbiotic Cloak can absorb armor and replicate its properties regardless of shape or size. The Armor’s normal statistics are maintained, however it’s appearance and form vary. Normally this cloak appears as a labcoat, however it’s true form is the same as your omni tool, a shiny metallic symbiote reminiscent of gallium that flows like liquid metal. You can command it to change forms as a bonus action. It can flow into your body’s pores the same as your omni tool appearing as a metallic tattoo covering your torso and legs. As long as your armor is not in tattoo form it functions as normal armor, however it is indistinguishable from ordinary clothes until you are attacked at which point it either stops the blow if it is protected or extrudes a protective shield to unarmored areas. In this case the AC of the armor you are actually wearing becomes as apparent as if they saw the actual armor. You may not absorb any special properties of the armor. 
    
-   Level 3: +1 Armor
    
-   Level 4: Rapid Charging (You may recharge your armor as a bonus action Your armor also has 10 charges)
    
-   Level 5: Iron Web (You may use an action to attempt to grapple a target 30 feet away from you or closer by spraying them with your symbiote and roping them down with metallic tendrils. You make this grappling check with your intelligence modifier, and it occupies one of your hands and you can move no further than 30 linear feet from your target. Other than this, the grapple has no other effects on you. If the target breaks the grapple you lose one charge from your symbiote, if you release it on your own you do not lose any charges. You cannot use this ability if you have less than 3 charges remaining.)
    
-   Level 6: Symbiotic Strength (You may spend 1 charge to use your intelligence instead of strength for a strength check or saving throw)
    
-   Level 7: Steel Angel (You may spend 5 charges to cause the symbiote to transform into a pair of large metallic wings. You gain a flying speed of 45 feet for the next 10 minutes.)
    
-   Level 8: +2 Armor
    
-   Level 9: Elemental Resistance (Your armor grants you resistance to a specific type of elemental damage)
    
-   Level 10: Antimagic injection (As a reaction to falling under a spell's effect, you may expend 5 charges to inject yourself with antimagic. Until the end of your next turn you act as if under the effects of the antimagic field spell, meaning all attunement is suppressed as well as spells. Furthermore if a spell has an effect on you that lasts such as charm person or protection from good and evil the effect ends instead of being suppressed. The symbiote loses all standard properties. If you are in the air, it locks down your body restraining you and causes you to stay in position. If you are on the ground it transforms into the armor it has absorbed until your attunement returns. You may attempt to use this feature as a reaction or an action on someone else by using your omnitool’s direct injection property. When used on yourself you need not be conscious or willing, as the armor acts independently.)
    
-   Level 11: Puppet strings (As an action you may make an attack against a target using the omni tool and your intelligence modifier to hit. This can only target medium or smaller creatures. The target’s physical movements come under your control as thin metallic wires wrap around it and control it. The target may make a strength check against your craftsmanship score to attempt to break the omnitools restraints. On a succes your symbiote loses 5 charges, on a failure the target takes 1d4 slashing damage.)
    
-   Level 12: Defensive shielding, as a bonus action you may expend one charge to activate a shield similar to an awakened shield for 10 minutes. 
    
-   Level 13: +3 Armor
    
-   Level 14: Additional Charges (You now have 15 charges)
    
-   Level 15: Unconscious Movement (Should you die, go down, or lose consciousness, your symbiote may simply move around with you inside it. It fully encloses you transforming into a metallic humanoid, The symbiote retains its AC as well as any features of it or the Omnitool, but otherwise cannot use magic or magic items. It is immune to charmed,sleep,and effects that target humanoids or require a mind to function. The symbiote has hp equal to the number of charges left *10. It cannot verbally communicate. While awakened in this state the symbiote’s sole objective is protecting its owner and it will take any action to ensure the safety of its owner. Any damage the symbiote takes is also taken by the person inside of it, and if it drops to 0 hp, it dies, though it can be regrown over 1d4 weeks as long as any parts of it remain and it can be consistently fed metal. This state can also be activated by the owner voluntarily and instructed to perform simple tasks or to protect someone else in a similar fashion.)
